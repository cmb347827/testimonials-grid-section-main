## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap
- Sass/SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- From now on I will start coding the layout with almost empty elements, instead of with 
  all the text , as I'm still learning , it was unwieldy to oversee. 
- I used the Scss @each directive for the first time. It made it easier to apply the same code to numerous elements.
- I have coded this type of grid layout in the past using CSS grids, but this time I wanted to use only Bootstrap, which was 
  a bit of a challenge. I think it would have been easier in just CSS grid.

### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS, some jQuery. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
